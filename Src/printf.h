 *
 * Description:
 *   This file defines the public interface for a tiny, thread-safe, and
 *   reentrant implementation of printf, sprintf, and snprintf. It is
 *   optimized for embedded systems and provides an alternative to standard
 *   library functions. It includes macros to override standard function names
 *   and declares the function prototypes for the custom implementation.
 *
 * Notes:
 *   - This implementation is based on code by Marco Paland and is licensed
 *     under the MIT License.
